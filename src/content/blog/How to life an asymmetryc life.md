Recently, I was watching a talk by Graham Weaver, CEO of Alpine Investors, in which he addressed the topic of how to lead an authentic life and maximize its quality. First, he shared a personal experience in which he lost half of his investors' money and the lessons he learned regarding investments. However, what caught my attention the most in his speech, and, of even greater importance, were the four principles he presented for achieving an authentic life.
## 4 Principles 💡

### Do hard things 💪
When you seek to make changes or improvements in your life, most of the time, it won't be easy. You must be willing to confront difficult challenges and make changes in your life. It's normal for things to get worse at the beginning, as changes involve risks, discomfort, and require you to step out of your comfort zone.

> The first move is always gonna be worse

The idea behind this principle is to overcome difficulties and move forward, even if the first step is tough. With time and your consistent effort, you will find yourself in a better place than where you started. You should not fear facing these challenges as they are what will help you improve your life.

### Do your thing ✨
In this principle, the speaker in the talk discusses how life, despite varying opinions, is full of difficulties, complex challenges, and moments of suffering. However, it also has its extraordinary and happy moments. He suggests that if you're going to face difficulties, you should do it for something worthwhile.

> Life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for

With this phrase, the speaker wants to convey the message of finding your passion in life and a purpose worth living for, something you genuinely believe in and are willing to face challenges and obstacles for.

### Do It for Decades ⌛
This principle focuses on the importance of long-term commitment. If your goal is to live an authentic and great life, it's not enough to experiment in something for a short period. You must be willing to commit to your goals and projects for decades. This long-term commitment is what sets apart those who achieve extraordinary success from those who give up at the first complex hurdle.

> Extraordinary results are not achieved with ordinary efforts.

### Write your own story ✍️
At this point, the speaker encourages you to take control of your life and destiny. You shouldn't just accept what life presents to you but actively confront it and create your own story.

>Don't write a story about what happened, write your story, then make that happen.

> The "how" is the killer of all great things.

In general, these principles emphasize the importance of determination, purpose, and taking control of your life to lead a satisfying and authentic life that leads to greatness.
