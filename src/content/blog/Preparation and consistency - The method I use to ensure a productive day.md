**My Day Doesn't Start When I Wake Up, But the Night Before 🌙**

In this article, I want to share how my nighttime preparation has transformed my productivity. Experts say that 90% of successful people have a well-defined daily routine, and this structure can make a real difference in our days. Through my experience, I’d like to share the routine that works for me and has helped me achieve truly productive days.

> Before going further, a quick tip: you don’t need to copy this routine exactly. Use it as a guide or reference to create your own routine based on your goals and lifestyle. The key is to adapt what works for you.

## Why Does My Routine Start the Night Before? 🌜

One of the keys to my productivity is in the night before. Starting at 9:00 p.m., I stop using any device with a screen: no smartphone, no computer, no distractions. This is my cue to unplug. I usually take a shower, wash my face, brush my teeth, and put on my sleepwear. This small ritual signals my mind that it’s time to relax and prepare for rest.

At 9:30 p.m., I turn off almost all lights, leaving only a bedside lamp. I get into bed and read a physical book, avoiding the stimulation of screens, which tend to keep the brain alert. I choose something light, usually fiction or something that doesn’t require much focus. Right now, I'm reading _The Hobbit_ by J.R.R. Tolkien. By 10:00 p.m., I’m asleep, ready to start the next day with full energy. Sleeping well is a **non-negotiable** in my routine because, at 5:30 a.m., my day begins. Without adequate rest, it’s tough to stay productive.

## A Productive Morning 🌅

At 5:30 a.m., I wake up and start by taking a moment to express gratitude. Reflecting on something positive about the new day—no matter your beliefs—just being able to wake up is reason enough to be thankful, and it can set a good tone for the morning. My first activities are consistent: I drink the glass of water I left ready the night before, make my bed, feed my dog, have breakfast, and take a shower to start with energy.

These activities are now part of my day-to-day and I do them almost automatically. At 8:00 a.m., it’s time for one of the most important steps in my routine: planning my day. These 30 minutes of planning are crucial to ensuring that the day will be productive and organized.

## The Magic 30 Minutes ✍️

Before starting any tasks, events, or meetings, I dedicate 30 minutes to organizing my day. While it may seem that these minutes could be used for something else, the reality is that investing this time saves me a lot throughout the day. Clearly planning tasks and priorities at the start of the day helps me stay focused, and these 30 minutes end up multiplying my productivity.

## How I Organize My Day 🗓️

Throughout the day, I jot down pending tasks in a list, and if it’s a fixed-time event, I place it directly on my calendar. When I sit down every morning to plan, I already have a preliminary list of what I need to do.

Then, I review the time blocks I have available and arrange each task according to urgency and importance. Sometimes, I realize that some tasks can be postponed or delegated, which frees up time for higher-priority things. I also like to leave small gaps between blocks; the day can be unpredictable, and having open spaces allows me to rearrange things if needed. Without these gaps, the day can feel overwhelming, which directly impacts my productivity.

## There Is No Magic Routine ✨

This routine is adapted to my habits, activities, type of work, hobbies, and lifestyle. The key isn’t in copying an exact routine but in organizing your time in a way that lets you make the most of it and feel good about your day-to-day. Consistency is essential for reaching your goals, but even more important is enjoying the process. Rather than focusing solely on your goals, center your attention on your systems, and you’ll see how the results come naturally.

Goals are useful for setting direction, but true progress comes from the habits, routines, and systems you design to achieve them.
